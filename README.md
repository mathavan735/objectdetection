Title:
24/7 Watch Dog – AI-Powered Smart Surveillance System

Small Description:
24/7 Watch Dog is an intelligent surveillance system that allows users to connect their cameras for real-time object detection. Using YOLO for advanced deep learning-based analysis, it identifies dangerous objects and sends instant alerts, enhancing security and proactive threat detection.

About:
24/7 Watch Dog is designed to provide an AI-driven surveillance solution that ensures safety by leveraging YOLO-based object detection. Traditional CCTV systems rely on manual monitoring, which can be inefficient and prone to human error. This project overcomes such challenges by automating threat detection and alert notifications, making surveillance smarter and more efficient.

Features:
✔ Real-time dangerous object detection using YOLO.
✔ Seamless camera connectivity for live monitoring.
✔ Instant alert system for security threats.
✔ Built using React for a lightweight and efficient web interface.
✔ No server dependency—runs entirely on the client-side.
✔ Scalable and adaptable for different security environments.

Requirements:
Operating System: Works on all modern web browsers (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Development Environment: React.js for frontend development.
Deep Learning Framework: YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection.
Image Processing Libraries: TensorFlow.js / OpenCV.js for on-the-fly analysis (if applicable).
Version Control: GitHub for collaborative development and updates.
Hosting Platform: Deployed on Netlify for easy access and availability.
Detection Accuracy:
Achieved a high detection accuracy based on the YOLO model’s training data and real-world testing. Performance metrics can be adjusted based on further optimization.

Results and Impact:
24/7 Watch Dog significantly enhances security by reducing the need for constant human monitoring. By leveraging AI, it provides a more reliable, real-time, and automated surveillance solution. This project sets the foundation for future advancements in AI-powered security systems and can be extended to various domains such as smart homes, industrial security, and law enforcement applications.
